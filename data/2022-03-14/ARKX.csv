"The principal risks of investing in ARK ETFs include equity, market, management and non-diversification risks, as well as fluctuations in market value and net asset value ('NAV'). Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives and risks as well as charges and expenses of an ETF before investing. This and other information are contained in each ETF's prospectus, which may be obtained by contacting the ETF's transfer agent The Bank of New York Mellon or by clicking here. Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest. The market price of ETF shares may differ significantly from their NAV during periods of market volatility. ETF shares may only be redeemed directly with the ETF at NAV by Authorized Participants, in very large creation units. Holdings are subject to change without notice and are not a recommendation to buy or sell any security. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns.
